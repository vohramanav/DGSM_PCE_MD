\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:disc}

%\begin{enumerate}
%\item Methodology is agnostic to the choice of surrogate.
%\item Outcome of parameter screening is QoI dependent. 
%\item As required for a PCE, the uncertain parameters need not be independent. 
% When working with a computational budget, consider relaxing the tolerance. 
% Higher the dimension reduction, greater the gains. However, in case of intensive models, even a small reduction could be
%advantageous. 
% In general, computational advantage is not guaranteed. Nevertheless, the proposed methodology is promising. 
% Gains with a reduced order surrogate are multiplied several time when evaluating the posterior distribution of the parameters
%since several surrogates are needed.
