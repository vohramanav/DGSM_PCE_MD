\section{Application: H$_2$/O$_2$ Reaction Kinetics}
\label{sec:app}

%Problem set-up: something about the reaction - why is it important?
%different reactions, reaction rate definition, uncertain parameters,
%quantity of interest. 
%
%Implementation of the proposed methodology for two scenarios: lean
%mix and rich mix. Describe what we mean by lean and rich using
%stoichiometry. 
%
%Define all the inputs as per the framework and illustrate its
%implementation to this application for both scenarios
