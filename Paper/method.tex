%Stage1: QoI selection for accurate estimation of derivatives and PCE, Stage 2: Parameter Screening, Stage 3: Reduced-order Surrogate Verification
%
%1. Goal is to estimate the upper bound on Sobol total-effect index using DGSM. 
%2. QoI should be differentiable w.r.t all the parameters. 
%3. Derivative could be estimated analytically or numerically.
%4. The expected value of the partial derivative w.r.t a given parameter is approximated over a few samples.
%5. Gradually enhance the sample size until some degree of convergence is established.
%6. Note that model runs at the full parameter space will be used for verification of the ROS. However, one could consider
%relaxing the convergence criterion to reduce computational costs. 
%7. Consider the product of Ci and mu_i to screen parameters.
