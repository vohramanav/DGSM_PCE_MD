Sequence of steps for parameter screening:
1. Generate "params.txt" for a given sample size, say N
2. "params.txt" will have N(d+1) points as needed for DGSM. Extract the new set
   of 5 points and write to file using "write_params.m".
3. Create sw files (5*8) from these points.
4. Set-up MD runs based on these sw files. 
5. Transfer the resulting log files from accre and save in a new dir
6. update names of the log files with single numeric (1-9) to (01-09).
7. Create "Energy.txt" using extract_energy.bash
8. Combine "Energy.txt" from all sets to create a "combined_Energy.txt" file,
   consistent with "params.txt" by modifying combine_energy.m
9. Create Lr.txt that contains relaxed lengths using extract_Lr.bash
10. Combine Lr.txt from all sets to create "combined_Lr.txt" by modifying
    combine_Lr.m  
11. Run "k_from_MD.py" to generate "k_data.txt"
12. Modify screen.m to update nsams and compute ub using screen.m
