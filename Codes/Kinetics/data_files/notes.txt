1. Sample 5 points in the 19D parameter space. We will have 100 points. Generate the data file using
"gen_samples.m". Name the data file according to the random number used.
2. Update "run_TChem.bash" for the filename as per step 1. 
3. Execute "run_TChem.bash".
4. Update the matlab file: "compute_dgsm.m" to consider the QoI for newly added points in Step 4.
5. Execute "compute_dgsm.m" to compute the sensitivity meaures.
6. Save the newly computed metrics in 'ub' and measures in 'mu' as a matlab file with name containing the total number of points used in the computation.
